# Super Quant Coders
Robotics Intelligence & Algorithmic Finance Core Interface
The digital uplink for Super Quant Coders (SQC) at NIT Jalandhar. This portal is a high-fidelity, industrial-grade interface designed to showcase our research in quadruped robotics and high-frequency quantitative trading models.
🛠 Engineering StackThis terminal is built with a focus on low-latency visual feedback and "Obsidian-Steel" 

UI Framework: 
- Tailwind CSS (JIT Engine)

Typography:
Syncopate (Industrial Display) & Space Mono (Data-Stream)

Interactions: Custom Vanilla JS Easing Engine

Aesthetics: Multi-tonal Obsidian palette (Slate-950, Deep Azure, and Metallic Steel)
Interface Architecture: 
The UI utilizes a Layered Depth System to move beyond flat web design:
- 1. The Atmospheric GridA 60px dual-tone blue grid paired with fixed radial gradients to simulate "hardware light leakage" and industrial sensor arrays.
 - 2. Plasma Glow InteractionA custom JavaScript-calculated cursor glow that utilizes an easing factor ($0.05$) to provide fluid, organic movement that follows the user's terminal inputs.
- 3. Machined Glass MetricsMetric cards are engineered using backdrop-filter: blur(15px) and metallic Slate-700 borders, mimicking a physical control panel.
  
🚀 Key Visual ModulesDynamic Dissolve: Imagery utilizes a radial black mask and grayscale-to-color transition on hover to simulate "system re-materialization.

"Performance Telemetry: Integrated cards showcasing SIH 2023 victory, Global Quant Hack rankings, and active deployment cycles.Scan-line Modulation: A subtle CSS linear animation overlaying the hero section to mimic CRT robotics monitors.Obsidian Depth: Shifted from pure black to a Slate-950 depth to prevent "black crush" and enhance contrast on high-end displays.
